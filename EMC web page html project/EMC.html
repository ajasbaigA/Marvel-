   <p>Rockets that employ chemical propellants come in different forms, but all share analogous basic components. These are (1) a combustion chamber where condensed-phase propellants are converted to hot gaseous reaction products, (2) a nozzle to accelerate the gas to high exhaust velocity, (3) propellant containers, (4) a means of feeding the propellants into the combustion chamber, (5) a structure to support and protect the parts, and (6) various guidance and control devices.</p>

   <p>Chemical rocket propulsion systems are classified into two general types according to whether they burn propellants stored as solid or as liquid. Solid systems are usually called motors, and liquid systems are referred to as engines. Some developmental work has been carried out on so-called hybrid systems, in which the fuel is a solid and the oxidizer is a liquid, or vice versa. The characteristics of such systems differ greatly depending on the requirements of a given mission.</p>
